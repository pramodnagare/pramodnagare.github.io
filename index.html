<p>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my page.</p>

<p>
I am Pramod Nagare, a recent <b>graduate in Computer Software Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston.</b> In my academics, I have implemented many projects that cover the latest technologies such as Data Science, Big Data, Business Intelligence, Cognitive Computing, Cloud Computing, and DevOps. Also, I was a </b>Teaching Assistant in the College of Engineering department at NEU</b> for the course Advanced Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Digital Marketing, in which I have assisted more than 100 students with the industry best practices, conducted demos, brainstorm the ideas with students, graded the assignments and performed other administrative tasks.
</p>

<p>
In Addition to my academic credentials, I have a strong experience as a <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b> at AI Foundry for 8 months. As it was a start-up company to provide data-driven solutions to the Mortage Industry, I was engaged with many tasks and It was a great experience. Also, I have </b>3 years of experience in Business Intelligence technology</b> at Infosys Limited, India, where I have developed data integration and analytics solutions for the client American Express.

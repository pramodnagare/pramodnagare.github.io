<p>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my page.</p>

<p>
I am Pramod Nagare, a seasoned Data Engineer with over eight years of experience in the IT industry. Currently, I serve as a Senior Data Engineer at the Institute of Experiential AI, Northeastern University, where I specialize in designing and implementing scalable data engineering solutions. My expertise lies in understanding client requirements and transforming them into practical, end-to-end applications, ensuring seamless execution across the entire development lifecycle. My commitment to delivering high-quality, innovative solutions has consistently earned recognition from both employers and clients.
</p>

<p>
In my current role at IEAI, Northeastern University, I actively contribute to multiple projects, collaborating with research scientists and industry partners to address a variety of business challenges. My responsibilities include designing robust data engineering architectures and facilitating coordination between data scientists and key stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

Prior to this, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at AI Foundry, a startup focused on delivering data-driven solutions for the mortgage industry. This dynamic role exposed me to diverse challenges and provided invaluable hands-on experience in applying machine learning to real-world problems. Additionally, I spent three years at Infosys Limited, India, specializing in Business Intelligence technology, where I developed data integration and analytics solutions for American Express.
</p>

<p>
Academically, I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Systems from Northeastern University, Boston, during which I served as a Teaching Assistant for courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Data Science, and Digital Marketing Analytics. This role enhanced my leadership skills, allowing me to mentor students, share industry best practices, and guide them through technical challenges and project development. Furthermore, my current position has given me the opportunity to lead a team of 2 to 3 engineers, further refining my managerial and leadership abilities.
